The [communityii/yii2-user](https://github.com/communityii/yii2-user) extension is a configurable user management module for [Yii 2.0 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com) with inbuilt social authentication and various user management controls. The module has been intentionally kept simple - yet enable yii developers to achieve user management & control for various use cases and scenarios. The module does not have RBAC (Role Based Access Control) inbuilt as an intention to keep it simple. 

There are a few access control methods that help achieve various use cases. However, for building advanced / complex specific use cases, almost every feature is configurable and extensible by the developer. Be it the module rules & settings, the model classes, the controller actions, the layouts, or the views - each of these can be customized. In addition few reusable components and widgets have been provided for expanding and building further use cases.
